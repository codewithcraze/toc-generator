                <h2 id="introduction-to-coding-fundamentals-1" tabindex="-1">Introduction to Coding Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>Coding is the process of using programming languages to give instructions to computers. As our world
                    grows increasingly digital, coding skills are becoming more and more valuable across industries.
                    Learning coding from scratch opens up new career opportunities, strengthens problem-solving
                    abilities, and enables you to build custom solutions.</p>
                <h3 id="understanding-the-coding-landscape-1" tabindex="-1">Understanding the Coding Landscape</h3>
                <p>Coding encompasses everything from simple website development using HTML and CSS to complex software
                    engineering with languages like Python and Java. There are hundreds of programming languages, each
                    with their own strengths. As a beginner, it's best to start with easier, versatile languages before
                    specializing.</p>
                <p>Some top languages for beginners include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML &amp; CSS:</strong> The building blocks of web development</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Adds interactivity to websites</li>
                    <li><strong>Python:</strong> General-purpose language great for beginners</li>
                    <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Retrieves and organizes data from databases</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The best part about learning coding basics is that most of the resources out there are completely
                    free. Structured courses, tutorials, documentation, and communities exist online to support your
                    learning journey.</p>
                <h3 id="the-benefits-of-learning-coding-from-scratch-1" tabindex="-1">The Benefits of Learning Coding
                    from Scratch</h3>
                <p>Here are some of the main advantages of starting from the basics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Builds logical thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
                    <li>Lays a solid technical foundation to advance upon</li>
                    <li>Allows you to customize software to meet your own needs</li>
                    <li>Opens doors to lucrative tech careers with lots of flexibility</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Learning coding from scratch, and not just specific tools, enables you to adapt more readily to new
                    languages. It also makes your skills more transferable across industries.</p>
                <h3 id="setting-realistic-goals-for-your-coding-journey-1" tabindex="-1">Setting Realistic Goals for
                    Your Coding Journey</h3>
                <p>When setting out to learn coding from scratch, it's important to chunk your learning into achievable
                    milestones:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Focus on learning language basics before tackling big projects
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Set timed goals:</strong> "I will spend 1 hour a day on coding basics for the next 3
                        months"</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus your learning:</strong> Choose one language instead of jumping randomly between
                        them</li>

                    Information</h3>
                <p>When learning to program, one of the first things you need to understand is how to store, reference,
                    and manipulate data. This is done using <strong>variables</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A variable acts as a container for information that can be referenced and updated in a
                            program.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>You give each variable a custom <strong>name</strong> to represent what kind of data it
                            holds, like <code>userName</code>, <code>age</code>, or <code>totalCost</code>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Variables have an associated <strong>data type</strong> that determines what type of data
                            they can store, like numbers, text, or true/false values. Common data types include:</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><code>int</code> - whole numbers</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><code>double</code> - decimal numbers</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><code>string</code> - text</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><code>boolean</code> - true/false logical values</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When you want to work with a variable's data, you simply reference it by name. For example,
                            you'd write <code>userName = "Mary"</code> to store the text "Mary" in the
                            <code>userName</code> variable.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding how to declare, initialize, and manipulate variables is essential to storing, accessing
                    and modifying data in any program you write as a coding beginner.</p>
                <h3 id="control-structures-directing-the-flow-1" tabindex="-1">Control Structures: Directing the Flow
                </h3>
                <p>The order in which statements execute in a program is called <strong>control flow</strong>. Control
                    structures give you greater control over this flow to conditionally execute code or repeat blocks of
                    code.</p>
                <p>The two most common control structures are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conditional statements</strong> - These allow you to check logical conditions and
                        execute different code blocks based on the outcome. For example:</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="wp-edit"></div>
                <pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (score &gt; 10) {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"You won!"</span>);
} <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Try again"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loops</strong> - These allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. For example:
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="wp-edit"></div>
                <pre><code class="hljs go"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; <span class="hljs-number">5</span>; i++) {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(i);
}
</code></pre>
                <p>This prints the numbers 0 to 4.</p>
                <p>Mastering control structures is key to directing how programs execute and dynamically responding to
                    different conditions.</p>
                <h3 id="functions-and-modular-coding-1" tabindex="-1">Functions and Modular Coding</h3>
                <p>A <strong>function</strong> is a reusable block of code that can be "called" from multiple places in
                    a program. Functions promote modular code by allowing you to break complex tasks down into smaller,
                    named steps.</p>
                <p>For example, you can encapsulate the logic to calculate sales tax in a <code>calculateTax()</code>
                    function instead of repeating the same tax formula everywhere.</p>
                <p>Benefits of using functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DRY code</strong> - Don't Repeat Yourself</li>
                    <li><strong>Reusability</strong> - Functions can be called anywhere</li>
                    <li><strong>Readability</strong> - Gives names to steps</li>
                    <li><strong>Encapsulation</strong> - Hides complex details</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As programs get more advanced, functions become critical for managing complexity.</p>
                <h3 id="understanding-syntax-and-semantics-1" tabindex="-1">Understanding Syntax and Semantics</h3>
                <p>When learning a programming language, you need to understand both its syntax and semantics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Syntax</strong> refers strictly to the structural rules of the language - the proper way
                        to write code so the computer can interpret it. Mismatched braces or incorrect punctuation will
                        lead to syntax errors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Semantics</strong> refers to what your code instructions actually mean and how they are
                        interpreted to influence program behavior. Two syntactically correct statements may produce
                        different results based on their semantic meanings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Gaining an understanding of both syntax rules as well as the semantics of keywords, data types,
                    functions, etc. is crucial to writing code that functions as expected.</p>
                <p>Starting out, focus first on writing syntactically correct code and then learn how language semantics
                    impact resulting values, state changes, and program flow.</p>
